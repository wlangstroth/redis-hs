## Acknowledgements

Much  of  the  code  in  this  library is  inspired  by  the  work  of  Anders
Conbere   and  Alexander   Bogdanov   (author  of   the   [redis  library   on
Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/redis)).

The test suite was created with the kind help of Greg Collins and Doug
Beardsley (whose Snap Framework test suite format I followed).
